To test the valid_jwt rule in your Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy, you can follow these steps:

1. Set Up OPA and Your Policy
Ensure you have OPA installed and your policy file (e.g., policy.rego) ready. The policy should include your JWT validation logic.

2. Create a Test File
Create a test file (e.g., policy_test.rego) in the same directory as your policy. This file will contain test cases to validate the valid_jwt rule.

3. Write Test Cases
In the test file, use OPA's built-in testing framework to write test cases for different scenarios. Hereâ€™s an example:

policy.rego

rego
Copy code
package example.authz

import future.keywords.if

default allow = false

allow {
    valid_jwt
}

valid_jwt {
    input.token
    # First try using JWKS URL
    io.jwt.decode_verify(input.token, {"jwks_url": "https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/jwks.json"}, payload) if {
        payload
    }
    # Fallback to static keys if JWKS URL is not available
    io.jwt.decode_verify(input.token, {"keys": [{"kty": "RSA", "kid": "1", "use": "sig", "n": "base64-url-encoded-modulus", "e": "base64-url-encoded-exponent"}]}, payload) if {
        not payload
    }
}
policy_test.rego

rego
Copy code
package example.authz

import future.keywords.if

test_valid_jwt_with_jwks_url := {
    input := {
        "token": "valid.jwt.token.from.jwks.url"
    }

    result := true
    valid_jwt with input as input
}

test_invalid_jwt_with_jwks_url := {
    input := {
        "token": "invalid.jwt.token"
    }

    result := false
    not valid_jwt with input as input
}

test_valid_jwt_with_static_key := {
    input := {
        "token": "valid.jwt.token.using.static.key"
    }

    result := true
    valid_jwt with input as input
}

test_invalid_jwt_with_static_key := {
    input := {
        "token": "invalid.jwt.token"
    }

    result := false
    not valid_jwt with input as input
}
4. Run the Tests
Use the OPA CLI to run the tests. Navigate to the directory containing your policy and test files, then execute the following command:

sh
Copy code
opa test .
5. Evaluate the Results
OPA will execute the tests and output the results, indicating whether each test case passed or failed. Ensure that the test cases cover various scenarios, including:

Valid JWTs verified via the JWKS URL.
Invalid JWTs that should not be verified.
Valid JWTs verified using the static key.
Invalid JWTs that should not pass the static key verification.
Example JWT Tokens
For testing purposes, you will need sample JWTs. You can generate JWTs using online tools or libraries in your preferred programming language. Ensure that you create tokens that are signed with keys matching your JWKS endpoint and static key.

Sample JWT Generation (Python Example)
python
Copy code
import jwt

# Generate a JWT with a given secret or private key
def generate_jwt(secret, payload):
    token = jwt.encode(payload, secret, algorithm='HS256')
    return token

# Example payload
payload = {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "admin": True,
    "iat": 1516239022
}

# Secret or private key
secret = 'your-256-bit-secret'

# Generate the token
token = generate_jwt(secret, payload)
print(token)
Ensure that your test tokens align with the keys you are using in your policy.

Conclusion
By setting up comprehensive tests for your valid_jwt rule, you can ensure that your OPA policy correctly handles JWT verification. The tests should cover both valid and invalid scenarios to confirm that the policy behaves as expected.
